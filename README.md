# Deploy Microservice App With Docker 
## What is Docker?
Docker is a container platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into units called “containers.” 
Each container is a virtualized, isolated instance of an application that includes everything necessary for it to run independently. 
These containers are lightweight, portable and can run consistently in any environment that supports Docker, 
such as on-premises systems, cloud servers or container clusters.
### Describing The App
This app contains 5 microservices :
- Discovery Service
- Config Service
- Customer Service
- Account Service
- Gateway Service
## Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool that helps you define and share multi-container applications.
With Compose, you can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command,
you can spin everything up or tear it all down.
